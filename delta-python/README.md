[Delta Lake 1.0.0](https://delta.io/news/delta-lake-1-0-0-released/) was released recently. It contains many awesome features.

Among others : New programmatic [APIs to create tables](https://docs.delta.io/1.0.0/delta-batch.html#create-a-table), [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/delta-spark/1.0.0/) way to install delta lake & support for [Generated Columns](https://docs.delta.io/1.0.0/delta-batch.html#use-generated-columns). I made [this notebook](https://github.com/amineds/databricks/blob/main/delta-python/Delta-Spark-Python.py) to highlight these features.

Additionaly, the community is expending and there are new contributions to access Delta Lake without going via Spark. I came acroos these 2 python librairies : deltalake and delta-lake-reader. This [small notebook](https://github.com/amineds/databricks/blob/main/delta-python/Delta-Reader-Python.py) highlights the later one.

Need more info : [Delta Lake OSS](https://delta.io/) page & [Github repos](https://github.com/delta-io/).
