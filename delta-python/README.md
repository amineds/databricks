[Delta Lake 1.0.0](https://delta.io/news/delta-lake-1-0-0-released/) was released recently. It contains many awesome features.

Among others : New programmatic [APIs to create tables](https://docs.delta.io/1.0.0/delta-batch.html#create-a-table), [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/delta-spark/1.0.0/) way to install delta lake & support for [Generated Columns](https://docs.delta.io/1.0.0/delta-batch.html#use-generated-columns). I made [this notebook] to highlight these features.

Additionaly, the community is expending and there are new contributions to access Delta Lake without going via Delta. I came acroos these 2 librairies : deltalake and delta-lake-reader. This small notebook highlights the later one.
