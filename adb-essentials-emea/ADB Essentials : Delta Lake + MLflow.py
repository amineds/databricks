# MAGIC <!-- You can run this notebook in a Databricks environment. Specifically, this notebook has been designed to run in [Databricks Community Edition](http://community.cloud.databricks.com/) as well. -->
# MAGIC To run this notebook, you have to [create a cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/create.html) with version **Databricks Runtime 7.6 ML or later** and [attach this notebook](https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/notebooks-manage.html#attach-a-notebook-to-a-cluster) to that cluster. <br/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Source Data for this notebook
# MAGIC The data used is a modified version of the public data from [Lending Club](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data). It includes all funded loans from 2012 to 2017. Each loan includes applicant information provided by the applicant as well as the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. For a full view of the data please view the data dictionary available [here](https://resources.lendingclub.com/LCDataDictionary.xlsx).

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC An open-source storage layer for data lakes that brings ACID transactions to Apache Sparkâ„¢ and big data workloads.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * **ACID Transactions**: Ensures data integrity and read consistency with complex, concurrent data pipelines.
# MAGIC * **Unified Batch and Streaming Source and Sink**: A table in Delta Lake is both a batch table, as well as a streaming source and sink. Streaming data ingest, batch historic backfill, and interactive queries all just work out of the box. 
# MAGIC * **Schema Enforcement and Evolution**: Ensures data cleanliness by blocking writes with unexpected.
# MAGIC * **Time Travel**: Query previous versions of the table by time or version number.
# MAGIC * **Deletes and upserts**: Supports deleting and upserting into tables with programmatic APIs.
# MAGIC * **Open Format**: Stored as Parquet format in blob storage.
# MAGIC * **Audit History**: History of all the operations that happened in the table.
# MAGIC * **Scalable Metadata management**: Able to handle millions of files are scaling the metadata operations with Spark.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Import Data and create pre-Delta Lake Table
# MAGIC * This will create a lot of small Parquet files emulating the typical small file problem that occurs with streaming or highly transactional data

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Delta Lake brings ACID transactions and full DML support to data lakes.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC >Parquet does **not** support these commands - they are unique to Delta Lake.

# COMMAND ----------

# Load new DataFrame based on current Delta table
lbs_df = sql("select * from loan_by_state_delta")

# Save DataFrame to Parquet

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Attempting to run `DELETE` on the Parquet table
# MAGIC DELETE FROM loan_by_state_pq WHERE addr_state = 'IA'

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### INSERT or UPDATE parquet: 7-step process
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC With a legacy data pipeline, to insert or update a table, you must:
# MAGIC 1. Identify the new rows to be inserted
# MAGIC 2. Identify the rows that will be replaced (i.e. updated)
# MAGIC 3. Identify all of the rows that are not impacted by the insert or update
# MAGIC 4. Create a new temp based on all three insert statements
# MAGIC 5. Delete the original table (and all of those associated files)
# MAGIC 6. "Rename" the temp table back to the original table name
# MAGIC 7. Drop the temp table
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ![](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/merge-into-legacy.gif)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### INSERT or UPDATE with Delta Lake
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 2-step process: 
# MAGIC 1. Identify rows to insert or update
# MAGIC 2. Use `MERGE`

# COMMAND ----------

# Let's create a simple table to merge
items = [('IA', 10), ('CA', 2500), ('OR', None)]
cols = ['addr_state', 'count']
merge_table = spark.createDataFrame(items, cols)
merge_table.createOrReplaceTempView("merge_table")
display(merge_table)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Instead of writing separate `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements, we can use a `MERGE` statement. 

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC MERGE INTO loan_by_state_delta as d
# MAGIC USING merge_table as m
# MAGIC on d.addr_state = m.addr_state
# MAGIC WHEN MATCHED THEN 
# MAGIC   UPDATE SET *
# MAGIC WHEN NOT MATCHED 
# MAGIC   THEN INSERT *

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Review current loans within the `loan_by_state_delta` Delta Lake table
# MAGIC select addr_state, sum(`count`) as loans from loan_by_state_delta group by addr_state

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ##  ![Delta Lake Tiny Logo](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/delta-lake-tiny-logo.png) Use Schema Evolution to add new columns to schema
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC If we *want* to update our Delta Lake table to match this data source's schema, we can do so using schema evolution. Simply add the following to the Spark write command: `.option("mergeSchema", "true")`

# COMMAND ----------

# Generate new loans with dollar amounts 
loans = sql("select addr_state, cast(rand(10)*count as bigint) as count, cast(rand(10) * 10000 * count as double) as amount from loan_by_state_delta")
display(loans)

# COMMAND ----------

# Let's write this data out to our Delta table
loans.write.format("delta").mode("append").save(DELTALAKE_SILVER_PATH)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md **Note**: This command fails because the schema of our new data does not match the schema of our original data

# COMMAND ----------

# Add the mergeSchema option
loans.write.option("mergeSchema","true").format("delta").mode("append").save(DELTALAKE_SILVER_PATH)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md **Note**: With the `mergeSchema` option, we can merge these different schemas together.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Review current loans within the `loan_by_state_delta` Delta Lake table
# MAGIC select addr_state, sum(`amount`) as amount from loan_by_state_delta group by addr_state order by sum(`amount`) desc limit 10

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## ![Delta Lake Tiny Logo](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/delta-lake-tiny-logo.png) Delta Lake Time Travel

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Delta Lakeâ€™s time travel capabilities simplify building data pipelines for use cases including:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * Auditing Data Changes
# MAGIC * Reproducing experiments & reports
# MAGIC * Rollbacks
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As you write into a Delta table or directory, every operation is automatically versioned.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/risan4841/img/blob/master/transactionallogs.png?raw=true" width=250/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can query snapshots of your tables by:
# MAGIC 1. **Version number**, or
# MAGIC 2. **Timestamp.**
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC using Python, Scala, and/or SQL syntax; for these examples we will use the SQL syntax.  
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For more information, refer to the [docs](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-utility.html#history), or [Introducing Delta Time Travel for Large Scale Data Lakes](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/02/04/introducing-delta-time-travel-for-large-scale-data-lakes.html)

# MAGIC ## Problem Statement: Classifying "bad loans" for a lender
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This notebook tackles a classification problem on the Lending Club dataset, with the goal of identifying "bad loans" (loans likely to be unprofitable) based on a combination of credit scores, credit history, and other features.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The end goal is to produce an interpretable model that a loan officer can use before deciding whether to approve a loan. Such a model provides an informative view for the lender as well as an immediate estimate and response for the prospective borrower.
